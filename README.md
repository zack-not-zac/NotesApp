# NotesApp
Basic Notes application for Android (CMP 309 module)

- https://medium.com/mindorks/android-architecture-components-room-viewmodel-and-livedata-50611793e4a9 used to create app, including ViewModels, LiveData and Room.

### To Do:
- Fix the editnote function to replace the note rather than creating a new one with the same contents.
- Fix nav menu so that when new note is selected while editing a note, it clears the text fields in the fragment.
